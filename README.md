## Overview

This Node.js API service provides [brief description of what your API does]. The service is built using Node.js, Express.js, and follows RESTful principles. It is designed to be lightweight, modular, and easily extendable.

## Features

- RESTful API design
- Environment-based configuration
- Unit and integration tests using Jest
- Docker support

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm (v6.x or higher)
- Docker (optional, for containerized environments)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moneysaini/BackendService.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

The service uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these variables directly in your environment or create a `.env` file in the root directory.

Example `.env` file:
```env
PORT=5000
```

## Running the Service

### In Development

To start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The service will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### In Production

To run the service in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

### Using Docker

You can also run the service in a Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-image-name .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 your-image-name
   ```

## Testing

Unit and integration tests are written using Jest. To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

You can customize this template to fit your specific project needs, such as updating sections to reflect your project's actual configuration and features.
